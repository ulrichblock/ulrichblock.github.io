This is source for the Blog [www.ulrich-block.de](https://www.ulrich-block.de).
It is realized with the static page generator [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and based on the starters [Gatsby Starter Blog Typescript](https://github.com/gperl27/Gatsby-Starter-Blog-Typescript) and [Developer Diary](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/willjw3/gatsby-starter-developer-diary/). Since using the starters, a lot has changed.
